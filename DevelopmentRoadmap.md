# GoodsSortingMatch3 - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
GoodsSortingMatch3 is a unique Match-3 game with a goods sorting mechanic. The game features a grid-based system where players match items by swapping them with empty spaces rather than adjacent items, creating a fresh take on the classic Match-3 formula.

## Development Approach

### 1. Core Game Architecture
The project is built using a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Grid System**: Handles the visual representation and logic of the game board
- **Manager Classes**: Control game states, levels, sorting, and power-ups
- **UI System**: Manages all user interface elements
- **Level Data**: Structured data for defining level configurations

### 2. Grid System Implementation
- Implemented a dual-layer grid system (front and back layers)
- Created a swap mechanic that works with empty spaces instead of traditional adjacent swapping
- Built a system for detecting and processing row matches
- Added visual effects for matches, selections, and item promotions

### 3. Level Management
- Designed a flexible level data structure that supports various configurations
- Implemented level loading and progression
- Created systems for tracking objectives and completion criteria
- Added support for time-limited levels

### 4. Special Powers & Mechanics
- Added power-ups like random match and board shuffle
- Implemented a section-based grid to create more strategic gameplay
- Created a promotion system where back-layer items move to the front when a row is cleared

### 5. UI Implementation
- Built a comprehensive UI system with:
  - Main menu
  - Level selection
  - In-game HUD
  - Level completion and failure screens
  - Pause functionality

## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

### Grid Management Complexity
**Challenge**: Managing the dual-layer grid system with appropriate visual representation was complex, especially ensuring proper Z-ordering and item visibility.

**Solution**: Created a specialized `GridItem` class with layer-aware rendering and implemented custom sorting orders for front and back items. Used Z-position offsets to ensure proper visual layering.

### Match Detection
**Challenge**: Traditional Match-3 algorithms needed significant modification to support our row-only matching and section-based design.

**Solution**: Developed custom match detection algorithms focused on horizontal matches within sections, with special consideration for empty spaces and the dual-layer system.

### Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: The grid system with multiple layers and visual effects could cause performance issues, especially on mobile devices.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented object pooling for grid items
- Optimized visual effects
- Reduced unnecessary updates by using event-driven architecture
- Carefully managed coroutines to spread computational load

### UI Responsiveness
**Challenge**: Ensuring the UI remains responsive across different screen sizes and orientations.

**Solution**: Created a flexible UI layout system with proper anchoring and implemented dynamic grid positioning to ensure the game board remains visible and properly centered.

## Key Design Decisions

### Section-Based Grid
We divided the grid into sections to create more strategic gameplay. Players must clear entire sections to progress, adding depth to the traditional Match-3 formula.

### Empty Space Swapping
Instead of swapping adjacent items, players swap items with empty spaces. This creates a unique puzzle dynamic where managing the position of empty spaces becomes critical to success.

### Dual-Layer System
The front and back layer system allows for more complex puzzles and progression. Back-layer items are promoted to the front when front rows are cleared, creating a sense of depth and adding strategic elements.

### Time-Limited Levels
To increase challenge and engagement, many levels have time limits. This adds urgency and rewards strategic thinking and quick decision-making.

## Future Enhancements
- Additional power-up types
- More complex level objectives
- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- Social features like leaderboards
- Daily challenges and events

## Technical Architecture
The game is built using Unity with a component-based architecture. Key systems include:
- `GridManager`: Core grid logic
- `InputHandler`: Player input processing
- `SortingManager`: Manages item sorting and matching objectives
- `LevelManager`: Handles level loading and progression
- `PowerManager`: Controls power-up functionality
- `UIManager`: Manages all UI elements and transitions

This architecture prioritizes maintainability, extensibility, and performance optimization.

## Conclusion
The development of GoodsSortingMatch3 focused on creating a fresh take on the Match-3 genre through unique mechanics while maintaining solid technical foundations. The challenges encountered were addressed through careful design and optimization, resulting in a unique and engaging gameplay experience.
